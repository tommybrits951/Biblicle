gucci gang gucci gang gucci gang gucci gang
 rollercoaster
 freefalling
 hitting hard
yelling
no one hears 
crying
no more tears 
fighting 
myself in the mirror 
counting 
how many more years 
without them 
what is fear 
without them 
what is cheer 
without them 
lost my taste for beer
I pray 
hope God hears 
My best friends 
I hope they pray 
I hope they 
walk the right way 
a straight path 
narrow gate 
keep them good 
for my heart sake 
life lessons
cant argue with liars 
cant argue with results unless your a liar 
cant work too hard 
csnt give tooo much 
can take too much 
hug the loneliest person 
never be the loudest (unless your pissed) 
nuthing wrong with falling in love 
life is supposed to be joyous 
not in dispair 
look around 
it sucks sleeping on concrete 
id rather you die doing good than live doing evil
pray always 
praise god always 
treat every elder like your parents 
treat every person like your brother or sister 
if you love yourself first you'll always have an excuse not to love others 




Family invites for good day at the game.
But I'm the game of the day.
they cast lots on my fear.
but I have nobody that hears.
what shall I fear.
oh well 
its ok 
its not hell 
beleive i seent it
no evil thing on earth ive saeen 
meets it 
the lords coming to wipe out even bacteria
from cali even to syria 
salvation is the lord salvation is the lord
sing that song sing it 
when i play a chord 
dont kneed to save it 
need to save you 
this is written thing 
the lord loves me i cant anymore
feel blue
im typing im typing
your all so desperate to hurt me
act like someones dying 
 what ever sighing.....
 i won alot too 
 guess what im buying 
 cant buy a soul 
 so stop smiling 
 the lord of hosts is at the door
 walks in and catches his sons beating each other
 with a smile on their face 
 so the lords wrath they will taste 
 its poured out apon u more than hell can take 
 knaw the tongue 
 knaw the tongue
  when its poured out 
  you thought you were hidden,
  a mystery,
  but the lord can erase you from more than thoughts
  even history 
  so look at yourselves
  stop waiting for someone to fail
  cuz this guy knows enough to put you all in jail
  but maybe that will save you from hell 
  stop sinning against me 
  thats why doesnt want to be round own family 
  cuz hes their reason for all their sins and blashemies
  so id rather stay a way
  so they aint thrown into the lake 
  because they couldnt leave someone be
  even for their own souls sake
  that hard to stop hurting someone
  is it now stare at him
  like hes a zit 
  like he a big pimple 
  stop sinning against him its very simple 
  or demons will rip you apart at death 
  satan hates is all 
  is respect is a lie at best
  what is respect without love 
  do you know what love is
  lets think about it 
  would you love someone who lies to you 
  woulde you love someone who laughs at you
  would youlove someone who hits you so much they leave a bruise
  would you love someone whi took from you 
  well guess what
  thats what the lord commanded us to do 
  so stop making fun of the lord servent 
  beleive me if you keep going
  YOULL DESERVE IT
